## Hello, friend!

My name is Rebekah Dumaup and I am a wedding, engagement, portrait, family, and maternity photographer based in Salt Lake City, Utah. My passion for photography started when I was a young girl in the Philippines. My father would often buy small, disposable film cameras, which I would occasionally find and take picture of random things. Though I didn't know what I was doing, looking through the view finder gave me different perspective on the world around me. Nothing felt better than hearing and feeling that mechanical "click" when the shutter went off. And, once the film was developed and pictures materialized, nothing tickled my nostalgic senses more than looking back at a random moment in time.

I have since traveled the world, but my love of photography has always been a constant. I believe the most beautiful images are those that paint a genuine, authentic, and precious moment in time. My goal with photography is to capture life's precious moments and turn your story into a timeless memory that you can cherish for a lifetime.
